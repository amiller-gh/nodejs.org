# Community Committee

The Community Committee (CommComm) is a top-level committee in the Node.js Foundation focused on community-facing efforts. Code commits !== the only way to contribute!

The CommComm has authority over community outreach including:
 - Community Evangelism
 - Education Initiatives
 - Cultural Direction of Node.js Foundation
 - Community Organization Outreach
 - Project Moderation/Mediation
 - Public Outreach and [Publications](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection)

There are four levels of engagement with the Community Committee:

 1. A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request.
 2. A **Collaborator** is a contributor who has been given write access to the repository
 3. An **Observer** is any individual who has requested or been requested to attend a CommComm meeting. It is also the first step to becoming a Member.
 4. A **Member** is a collaborator with voting rights who has met the requirements of participation and voted in by the CommComm voting process.

For the current list of Community Committee members, see the project's [README.md](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee).

## Collaborators

It is the mission of CommComm to further build out the Node.js Community. If you're reading this, you're already a part of that community â€“ and as a part of the Node.js Community, we'd love to have your help!

The [nodejs/community-committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) GitHub repository is a great place to start. Check out the [issues labeled "Good first issue"](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/labels/good%20first%20issue) to see where we're looking for help. If you have your own ideas on how we could engage and build the community, feel free to create your own issue.

If you're interested in participating in the Community Committee as a member, you should create an issue asking to be an Observer in our next Community Committee meeting. You can find a great example of such an issue [here](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/142).

Before diving in though, please be sure to read the [Collaborator Guide](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/COLLABORATOR_GUIDE.md).

## Membership

To become a member of the Community Committee, start participating! You must:

 1. Attend the bi-weekly meetings, investigate issues tagged as good first issue, file issues and pull requests, and provide insight via GitHub.
 2. Request to become an Observer by filing an issue. Once added as an Observer to meetings, we will track attendance and participation for 3 months, as according to our governance guidelines.
 3. When you meet the minimum attendance and participation expectations, the CommComm will vote to add you as a member.

Membership is for 6 months. The group will ask on a regular basis if the expiring members would like to stay on. A member just needs to reply to renew. There is no fixed size of the CommComm. However, the expected target is between 9 and 12. You can read more about membership, and other administrative details, in our [Governance Guide](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).

Regular CommComm meetings are held bi-monthly in a Zoom video conference, and broadcast live to the public on YouTube. Meeting announcements and agendas are posted before the meeting begins in the organization's [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues). Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The CommComm follows a [Consensus Seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) decision making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus, the moderator will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus. If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote is called. It is expected that the majority of decisions made by the CommComm are via a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.
